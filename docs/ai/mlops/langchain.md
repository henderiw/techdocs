## langchain

### context aware reasining applications
- instruction prompting
- few shot examples (showing)
- RAG 
- fine tuning (updating the weigths) -> many examples

### reasining
- llm call
- chaining (multiple llm) - you know what you are going to do
    e.g. GPT reasoning
- routing - dynamic 
- automatons/state machines
    e.g. reflexion
    sweep.dev (inputs, search/plan
- autonomous agents)

### challenges
- orchestration
- data engineering
- prompt engineering
- debugging
- evaluation
- collaboration
