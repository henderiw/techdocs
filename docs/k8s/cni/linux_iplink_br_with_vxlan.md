Creating a VXLAN tunnel and connecting it to a bridge using Netlink in Linux involves a series of steps that require administrative privileges. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

1. **Load the Required Kernel Modules (if not already loaded):**
   VXLAN and bridge functionality might require specific kernel modules to be loaded. You can use the `modprobe` command to load these modules if they are not already loaded.

2. **Create the VXLAN Interface:**
   Use the `ip` command with the `link` option to create a VXLAN interface. Replace `VXLAN_ID`, `SOURCE_IP`, `REMOTE_IP`, and `INTERFACE_NAME` with appropriate values.

   ```bash
   ip link add vxlan0 type vxlan id VXLAN_ID local SOURCE_IP remote REMOTE_IP dev INTERFACE_NAME
   ip link set vxlan0 up
   ```

3. **Create the Bridge Interface:**
   Use the `ip` command to create a bridge interface.

   ```bash
   ip link add br0 type bridge
   ip link set br0 up
   ```

4. **Add VXLAN Interface to the Bridge:**
   Attach the VXLAN interface to the bridge.

   ```bash
   ip link set vxlan0 master br0
   ```

5. **Assign IP Address to the Bridge:**
   Assign an IP address to the bridge interface so that you can manage it.

   ```bash
   ip addr add BRIDGE_IP/BRIDGE_CIDR dev br0
   ```

6. **Configure ARP Proxy on the Bridge (Optional):**
   If you want the bridge to respond to ARP requests on behalf of the VXLAN endpoints, you can enable ARP proxying.

   ```bash
   sysctl net.ipv4.conf.br0.proxy_arp=1
   ```

7. **Update Forwarding Rules:**
   Adjust forwarding rules to allow traffic between interfaces.

   ```bash
   sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
   ```

8. **Route Configuration (if needed):**
   Depending on your network topology, you might need to set up additional routing rules to ensure proper communication.

Remember that the exact commands and configuration details can vary based on your specific network setup, Linux distribution, and kernel version. Also, you might need to handle network namespaces, firewall rules, and other networking considerations.

Make sure you understand the implications of these steps and how they fit into your overall network architecture. Additionally, changes made using the `ip` command are not persistent across reboots by default, so you might need to consider mechanisms to make these configurations persistent.

Always exercise caution when making network changes, especially when working with critical systems or production environments. It's a good practice to test these configurations in a controlled environment before applying them in a production setting.
