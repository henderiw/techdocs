# storage protocols

UET might be an evolution for all of these

file storage
- NFS: TCP
- Lustre: TCP

Object storage
- CEPH: TCP, RDMA (ROCEv2) 

Block storage
- NVME: TCP, RDMA (ROCEv2)

## AI/ML:

- today mainly file and object
- block will grow in importance

-> checkpointing is an important use cases
